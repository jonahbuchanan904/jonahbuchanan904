## Hey.

I’m @jonahbuchanan904, and I am working on becoming a Network Engineer. 

*(2024-2025)* I’m currently a Senior IT major at Bob Jones University and I am working on making a gameplan for the order of certifications that I plan to get. I have been in this area of study for 3 years now and still *a little* new to everything.
